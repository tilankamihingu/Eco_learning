beings, or cause damage to the climate or to materials. There are different types of air pollutants, such as gases (such as ammonia, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, methane and chlorofluorocarbons), particulates (both organic and inorganic), and biological molecules. Air pollution may cause diseases, allergies and even death to humans; it may also cause harm to other living organisms such as animals and food crops, and may damage the natural or built environment. Both human activity and natural processes can generate air pollution.\r\n            Air pollution is a significant risk factor for a number of pollution-related diseases, including respiratory infections, heart disease, COPD, stroke and lung cancer.The human health effects of poor air quality are far reaching, but principally affect the body's respiratory system and the cardiovascular system. Individual reactions to air pollutants depend on the type of pollutant a person is exposed to, the degree of exposure, and the individual's health status and genetics.Indoor air pollution and poor urban air quality are listed as two of the world's worst toxic pollution problems in the 2008 Blacksmith Institute World's Worst Polluted Places report.Outdoor air pollution alone causes to 4.21 million deaths annually.Overall, air pollution causes the deaths of around 7 million people worldwide each year, and is the world's largest single environmental health risk.\r\n            Productivity losses and degraded quality of life caused by air pollution are estimated to cost the world economy $5 trillion per year.Various pollution control technologies and strategies are available to reduce air pollution.An air pollutant is a material in the air that can have adverse effects on humans and the ecosystem. The substance can be solid particles, liquid droplets, or gases. A pollutant can be of natural origin or man-made. Pollutants are classified as primary or secondary. Primary pollutants are usually produced by processes such as ash from a volcanic eruption. Other examples include carbon monoxide gas from motor vehicle exhausts or sulfur dioxide released from factories. Secondary pollutants are not emitted directly. Rather, they form in the air when primary pollutants react or interact. Ground level ozone is a prominent example of a secondary pollutant. Some pollutants may be both primary and secondary: they are both emitted directly and formed from other primary pollutants.</p>\r\n        </div> \r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"card mt-3\">\r\n        <div className=\"card-body\">\r\n          <h5 className=\"card-title font-weight-bold text-primary\">Sources</h5>\r\n          <h6 className=\"card-title\">Man-made</h6>\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li>Stationary sources include smoke stacks of fossil fuel power stations (see for example environmental impact of the coal industry), manufacturing facilities (factories) and waste incinerators, as well as furnaces and other types of fuel-burning heating devices. In developing and poor countries, traditional biomass burning is the major source of air pollutants; traditional biomass includes wood, crop waste and dung.</li>\r\n            <li>Mobile sources include motor vehicles, marine vessels, and aircraft.</li>\r\n            <li>Controlled burn practices in agriculture and forest management. Controlled or prescribed burning is a technique sometimes used in forest management, farming, prairie restoration or greenhouse gas abatement. Fire is a natural part of both forest and grassland ecology and controlled fire can be a tool for foresters. Controlled burning stimulates the germination of some desirable forest trees, thus renewing the forest.</li>\r\n            <li>Fumes from paint, hair spray, varnish, aerosol sprays and other solvents. These can be substantial; emissions from these sources was estimated to account for almost half of pollution from volatile organic compounds in the Los Angeles basin in the 2010s.</li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n          <h6 className=\"card-title\">Natural Sources</h6>\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li>Dust from natural sources, usually large areas of land with little vegetation or no vegetation</li>\r\n            <li>Radon gas from radioactive decay within the Earth's crust. Radon is a colorless, odorless, naturally occurring, radioactive noble gas that is formed from the decay of radium. It is considered to be a health hazard. Radon gas from natural sources can accumulate in buildings, especially in confined areas such as the basement and it is the second most frequent cause of lung cancer, after cigarette smoking.</li>\r\n            <li>Vegetation, in some regions, emits environmentally significant amounts of Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on warmer days. These VOCs react with primary anthropogenic pollutants—specifically, NOx, SO2, and anthropogenic organic carbon compounds — to produce a seasonal haze of secondary pollutants.Black gum, poplar, oak and willow are some examples of vegetation that can produce abundant VOCs. The VOC production from these species result in ozone levels up to eight times higher than the low-impact tree species.</li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"card mt-3\">\r\n        <div className=\"card-body\">\r\n          <h5 className=\"card-title font-weight-bold text-primary\">Health Effects</h5>\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li><h6>Cancer(lung Cancer)</h6></li>\r\n            <p className=\"card-text\">A review of evidence regarding whether ambient air pollution exposure is a risk factor for cancer in 2007 found solid data to conclude that long-term exposure to PM2.5 (fine particulates) increases the overall risk of non-accidental mortality by 6% per a 10 microg/m3 increase. Exposure to PM2.5 was also associated with an increased risk of mortality from lung cancer (range: 15% to 21% per 10 microg/m3 increase) and total cardiovascular mortality (range: 12% to 14% per a 10 microg/m3 increase). The review further noted that living close to busy traffic appears to be associated with elevated risks of these three outcomes – increase in lung cancer deaths, cardiovascular deaths, and overall non-accidental deaths. The reviewers also found suggestive evidence that exposure to PM2.5 is positively associated with mortality from coronary heart diseases and exposure to SO2 increases mortality from lung cancer, but the data was insufficient to provide solid conclusions.[84] Another investigation showed that higher activity level increases deposition fraction of aerosol particles in human lung and recommended avoiding heavy activities like running in outdoor space at polluted areas.</p>\r\n          </ul>\r\n        </div> \r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"card mt-3\">\r\n        <div className=\"card-body\">\r\n          <h5 className=\"card-title font-weight-bold text-primary\">Sentinel-5P brings air pollution into focus</h5>\r\n          <p className=\"card-text\">Launched on 13 October, the Sentinel-5P satellite has delivered its first images of air pollution. Even though the satellite is still being prepared for service, these first results have been hailed as exceptional and show how this latest Copernicus satellite is set to take the task of monitoring air quality into a new era.\r\n          This new mission promises to image air pollutants in more detail than ever before. And, while these first results demonstrate the sophistication of the satellite's instrument, they certainly bring the issue of air pollution sharply into focus.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h5 className=\"card-title font-weight-bold text-primary\">Monitoring air pollution from fires</h5>\r\n          <p className=\"card-text\">The wildfires that have been devastating the Amazon rainforest have been international headline news over the last weeks. These fires are not only an environmental tragedy in terms of lost forest and biodiversity, but they are also leaving their mark on the atmosphere, affecting air quality and, potentially, the global climate.\r\n          In light of the climate crisis, the loss of swathes of the forest is a serious concern. Everyone on Earth benefits from the health of rainforests like the Amazon. Trees act as sinks for carbon, absorbing and storing atmospheric carbon dioxide – one of the main greenhouse gases – and therefore helping to cool the planet.\r\n          Consumed by fires in recent months, forests are releasing much of the carbon dioxide they once stored in their biomass back into the atmosphere. However, there are also a host of other pollutants entering the air. The Copernicus Sentinel-5P mission is being used to closely monitor the changes in air quality.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div> \r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"card mt-3 bg-dark text-white\">\r\n        <div className=\"card-body\">\r\n          <h5 className=\"card-title font-weight-bold text-danger\">Solution</h5>\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li><h6 className=\"card-title text-primary\">Electricity</h6></li>\r\n            <p className=\"card-text\">Most of the countries are rich with sunlight and wind.

The most concentrated deforestation occurs in tropical rainforests.About 31% of Earth's land surface is covered by forests.</p>\r\n          <p className=\"card-text\">The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations defines deforestation as the conversion of forest to other land uses (regardless of whether it is human-induced). “Deforestation” and “forest area net change” are not the same: the latter is the sum of all forest losses (deforestation) and all forest gains (forest expansion) in a given period. Net change, therefore, can be positive or negative, depending on whether gains exceed losses, or vice versa</p>\r\n          <p className=\"card-text\">The primary driver of deforestation is the expansion of agriculture. Trees are cut down for use as building material, timber or sold as fuel (sometimes in the form of charcoal or timber), while cleared land is used as pasture for livestock and agricultural crops. The vast majority of agricultural activity resulting in deforestation is subsidized by government tax revenue.Disregard of ascribed value, lax forest management, and deficient environmental laws are some of the factors that lead to large-scale deforestation. Deforestation in many countries—both naturally occurring and human-induced—is an ongoing issue.[8] Between 2000 and 2012, 2.3 million square kilometres (890,000 sq mi) of forests around the world were cut down.\r\n          The removal of trees without sufficient reforestation has resulted in habitat damage, biodiversity loss, and aridity. Deforestation causes extinction, changes to climatic conditions, desertification, and displacement of populations, as observed by current conditions and in the past through the fossil record.Deforestation also has adverse impacts on biosequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide, increasing negative feedback cycles contributing to global warming. Global warming also puts increased pressure on communities who seek food security by clearing forests for agricultural use and reducing arable land more generally. Deforested regions typically incur significant other environmental effects such as adverse soil erosion and degradation into wasteland. According to a study published in Nature Scientific Reports if deforestation continue in current rate in the next 20 - 40 years, it can trigger a full or almost full extinction of humanity. To avoid it humanity should pass from a civilization dominated by the economy to \"cultural society\" that \"privileges the interest of the ecosystem above the individual interest of its components, but eventually in accordance with the overall communal interest</p>\r\n          <p className=\"card-text\">Deforestation is more extreme in tropical and subtropical forests in emerging economies. More than half of all plant and land animal species in the world live in tropical forests.As a result of deforestation, only 6.2 million square kilometres (2.4 million square miles) remain of the original 16 million square kilometres (6 million square miles) of tropical rainforest that formerly covered the Earth.An area the size of a football pitch is cleared from the Amazon rainforest every minute, with 136 million acres (55 million hectares) of rainforest cleared for animal agriculture overall.More than 3.6 million hectares of virgin tropical forest was lost in 2018.Consumption and production of beef is the primary driver of deforestation in the Amazon, with around 80% of all converted land being used to rear cattle.91% of Amazon land deforested since 1970 has been converted to cattle ranching.The global annual net loss of trees is estimated to be approximately 10 billion.According to the Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020 the global average annual deforested land in the 2015–2020 demi-decade was 10 million hectares and the average annual forest area net loss in the 2000–2010 decade was 4.7 million hectares.The world has lost 178 million ha of forest since 1990, which is an area about the size of Libya.</p>\r\n        </div> \r\n      </div>\r\n      \r\n      <div className=\"card mt-3\">\r\n        <div className=\"card-body\">\r\n          <h5 className=\"card-title font-weight-bold text-primary\">Environmental effects</h5>\r\n          \r\n            <p className=\"card-text\">Deforestation is a contributor to global warming,and is often cited as one of the major causes of the enhanced greenhouse effect. Tropical deforestation is responsible for approximately 20% of world greenhouse gas emissions.According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change deforestation, mainly in tropical areas, could account for up to one-third of total anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions.But recent calculations suggest that carbon dioxide emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (excluding peatland emissions) contribute about 12% of total anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions with a range from 6% to 17%.Deforestation causes carbon dioxide to linger in the atmosphere. As carbon dioxide accrues, it produces a layer in the atmosphere that traps radiation from the sun. The radiation converts to heat which causes global warming, which is better known as the greenhouse effect.Plants remove carbon in the form of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere during the process of photosynthesis, but release some carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere during normal respiration. Only when actively growing can a tree or forest remove carbon, by storing it in plant tissues. Both the decay and the burning of wood release much of this stored carbon back into the atmosphere. Although an accumulation of wood is generally necessary for carbon sequestration, in some forests the network of symbiotic fungi that surround the trees' roots can store a significant amount of carbon, storing it underground even if the tree which supplied it dies and decays, or is harvested and burned.Another way carbon can be sequestered by forests is for the wood to be harvested and turned into long-lived products, with new young trees replacing them.Deforestation may also cause carbon stores held in soil to be released. Forests can be either sinks or sources depending upon environmental circumstances. Mature forests alternate between being net sinks and net sources of carbon dioxide</p>\r\n            <p className=\"card-text\">In deforested areas, the land heats up faster and reaches a higher temperature, leading to localized upward motions that enhance the formation of clouds and ultimately produce more rainfall.[54] However, according to the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, the models used to investigate remote responses to tropical deforestation showed a broad but mild temperature increase all through the tropical atmosphere. The model predicted 0.2 °C warming for upper air at 700 mb and 500 mb. However, the model shows no significant changes in other areas besides the Tropics. Though the model showed no significant changes to the climate in areas other than the Tropics, this may not be the case since the model has possible errors and the results are never absolutely definite.Deforestation affects wind flows, water vapour flows and absorption of solar energy thus clearly influencing local and global climate.</p>\r\n        </div> \r\n      </div>\r\n     \r\n      <div className=\"card mt-3 bg-dark text-white\">\r\n        <div className=\"card-body\">\r\n          <h5 className=\"card-title font-weight-bold text-danger\">Solution</h5>\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li><h6 className=\"card-title text-primary\">Planting</h6></li>\r\n            <p className=\"card-text\">We want trees for our lives but these days most people are cut trees for some works.
